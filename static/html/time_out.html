                                <li><b>Connectedness: </b>Smart lights are almost always connected to the internet,
                                    making it difficult to control what data is collected. If you purchase a smart light
                                    that only connects to the internet when the blub is lit up, the data collections
                                    could be reduced to an acceptable level.</li>
                                <li><b>Sensing (Learning): </b>Creating a profile allows for your smart light to
                                    automate how you use the device over time. If you want to reduce how much data smart
                                    lights collect about you, do not create profiles.</li>
                                <li><b>Delegation (Automation): </b> Smart lights learn how often you turn lights on and
                                    off, creating a pattern of when your home is occupied. To reduce this, disable the
                                    learning mode through the accompanying apps. (You may need to find resources online
                                    to help you).</li>

                                    cameras, disconnect your smart cameras from the internet when you are home.</li>
                                <li><b>Sensing (Learning): </b>If you cannot disconnect your camera from the internet,
                                    facing the camera away from populated areas is the next best step to reducing
                                    unwanted data collection and learning. </li>

                                    data (such as video/audio feeds). If an open/public network is attacked, and you
                                    connect to the attacked network to remote control your smart camera, there is a risk
                                    that your camera feeds could be accessed by unauthorised parties.</li>
