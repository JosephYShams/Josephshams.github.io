    <h4>Welcome to the smart home configuration game.</h4>
    <p> This game aims to teach you what capabilities smart home devices can perform and
        the different
        ways you can interact with the device to limit the privacy risks each capability can
        introduce. </p>
    <p>The rules of the game are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You must purchase all 8 smart home devices.</li>
        <li>To purchase a device, you must first answer a configuration test. This configuration
            test
            evaluates your understanding of smart home device capabilities and what
            configuration behaviours
            reduce privacy risks associated with device capabilities.</li>
        <li>To help you answer the questions, a description of the 5 capabilities introduced in this game is provided on the main page
            (right-hand side.)</li>
